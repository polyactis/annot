<span lang="EN-GB">
The rapid accumulation of microarray datasets provides us unique opportunities to perform systematic functional characterization of human genome. We designed a graph-based approach to integrate cross-platform microarray data, and extract frequently occurring expression patterns. We model each microarray data set with a graph, where a vertex represents one gene, and if two genes show high correlation in their expression profiles, we connect them with an edge. A series of microarray data sets can be modeled as a series of co-expression networks, in which we search for frequently occurring network patterns. The integrative approach provides three major advantages over the commonly used microarray analysis methods: (1) enhance signal to noise separation (2)  identify functionally related genes without co-expression, and (3) provides a way to predict gene functions in a context-specific way.

  <b>Results</b>: </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">
We integrate 65 human microarray data sets, comprising 1105 experiments and 11404362 expression measurements. We developed a sophisticated data mining procedure based on frequent itemset mining and biclustering to systematically discover network patterns which recur in at least 5 datasets, which resulted in 143401 potential functional modules. Subsequently, we designed a network topology statistic based on graph random walk that effectively captures the characteristic of gene's local functional environment. Function annotations based on this statistic are then subject to the assessment of random forest with six other attributes of the network modules. We assigned 1126 functions to 895 genes, 779 known and 116 unknown, with a validation accuracy of 70%. Note that predictions on known genes were served only for validation in previous studies. Our predictions on known genes, on the other hand, are of great use in practice because they provide the context information of genes' function. Among our assignment, 20% genes are assigned with multiple functions upon different network environments.
