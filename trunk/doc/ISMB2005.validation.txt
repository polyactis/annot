We predicted YPR143W to participate in 'ribosome biogenesis'. In a personal communication of Fatica to SGD in 2004, it's involved in pre-rRNA processing. We assigned the function 'protein biosynthesis' to YMR116C. There're two papers showing it's involved in translation regulation(PMID 9504906) and control(PMID 15340087).

We predicted YLR204W(QRI5) to have 'protein biosynthesis' function. One paper indicates it's submitted to a common 	regulatory process with MSS51(PMID 1523888) and the GO annotation of MSS51 is positive regulation of translation and protein biosynthesis.

Another gene 'YER007C-A' is also predicted to have 'protein biosynthesis' and one paper(PMID 10093218) showed it's associated with translation machinery.
