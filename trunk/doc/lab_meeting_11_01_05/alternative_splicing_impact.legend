The impact of alternative RNA splicing
Alternative splicing can occur in any region of the nascent messenger RNA, in the 3¡¯ or 5¡¯ untranslated regions (UTRs) or in the protein coding sequence. The 5¡¯UTR sequence contains regulatory regions that control protein expression. Insertion or deletion of these regions will have a consequence on protein expression. The 3¡¯ UTR region contains mRNA stability domains. Insertion or deletion of these domains have consequences on mRNA stability and therefore protein expression. Alternative splicing within the protein coding sequence results in altered protein structure and function.
